# PySnake
### Python Game for fun and machine learning (ML)purposes for later

This is the first version of the Snake game to try out pygame. <br/>
Pygame is a python library, to create UI for a game, desktop application and so on...

---

The final goal is to create a ML neural network with reinforcement learning, and test on the game.
<br/>
:warning: The upcoming versions will go in that direction.
